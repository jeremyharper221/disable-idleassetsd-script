# Disable and Clean Idleassetsd Script
[cite_start]This guide will walk you through a simple process to fix a problem on macOS where a background service called `idleassetsd` can download large video files that take up a lot of disk space[cite: 1]. [cite_start]This script will permanently stop that service and safely remove any downloaded files[cite: 2].

## What This Script Does
* [cite_start]Permanently stops the `idleassetsd` background service so it can't download files again[cite: 3].
* [cite_start]Deletes any large video files that the service has already downloaded[cite: 4].
* [cite_start]Confirms that the files are gone[cite: 4].
* [cite_start]Shows a summary of your disk space at the end so you can see how much space was freed up[cite: 5].

## How to Use
1.  [cite_start]**Save the Script:** Copy all of the code from the document in the editor and paste it into a new file[cite: 6]. [cite_start]You can name the file something like `disable-idleassetsd.sh`[cite: 7].
2.  [cite_start]**Open Terminal:** Open the Terminal application on your Mac[cite: 8]. [cite_start]You can find it by searching for "Terminal" with Spotlight (`Command + Space`)[cite: 8].
3.  [cite_start]**Go to the Right Folder:** In the Terminal, type `cd` followed by a space and the path to the folder where you saved the file[cite: 9]. [cite_start]For example, if you saved the file to your desktop, you would type: `cd ~/Desktop`[cite: 10].
4.  [cite_start]**Give it Permission to Run:** Type the following command and press `Enter`[cite: 11]. [cite_start]This tells your computer that this file is a script that can be run[cite: 11].

    [cite_start]`chmod +x disable-idleassetsd.sh` [cite: 12]

5.  [cite_start]**Run the Script:** Type the final command below and press `Enter`[cite: 13]. [cite_start]The script needs administrator privileges to work, so you will be prompted to enter your password[cite: 13].

    [cite_start]`sudo ./disable-idleassetsd.sh` [cite: 14]

## What to Expect
* [cite_start]The script will provide a step-by-step summary of what it is doing[cite: 15].
* [cite_start]It will ask for your confirmation before deleting the files[cite: 15].
* [cite_start]At the very end, it will tell you that the process is complete and display a summary of your disk space[cite: 16].
